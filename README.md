# TOP-Etch-a-Sketch
This project was developed to comply for one of the projects in the JS lessons of The Odin Project's foundations course. The following skills were practiced as I develop this project:
* Implement DOM manipulation methods to dynamically adjust element interactions and display.
* Use arrays to temporarily store elements and make access convenient.
* Utilize event listeners to respond on user inputs.
