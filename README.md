# TOP-Etch-a-Sketch
This project was developed to comply for one of the projects in the JS lessons of The Odin Project's foundations course. It is inspired by a mechanical drawing toy called "Etch a Sketch" which is like a sketchpad that uses knobs to draw. This application, however, uses a grid to implement a similar effect and bring it in your browser. 

The following skills were practiced as I develop this project:
* Implement DOM manipulation methods to dynamically adjust element interactions and display.
* Use arrays to temporarily store elements and make access convenient.
* Utilize event listeners to respond on user inputs.

### Features

There are five buttons in the left side panel of the page that has different effects on your drawing experience:

1. **Change Grid Size:** Allows the user to enter a number in a prompt that is from 2 - 100 only. The input value n will make the grid that n x n size.

2. **Eraser Pointer:** Makes the mouse pointer be able to erase whatever color the cell/s it is drawing over has.

3. **Clear Board:** Clicking resets all of the color ink placed on the current board.

4. **Random Color Ink:** Makes the mouse pointer place random color as draw through the grid.

5. **Darkening Effect:** The mouse pointer will set the opacity of any cell/s it draws over, and will gradually darken those cells for each interaction with the mouse pointer. By default, it will have a black color, but it can also darken random colors.
